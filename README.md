# Waterful

A javascript and webgl version of the toy game Waterful. Found in dentist offices everywhere.

## Concept

A javascript and webgl remake of the 1970's ring toss game by TOMY.

### Game setup

The playing field is submerged in water inside a small container.  

Each game piece is a small, plastic, slightly heavier than water, ring (between 5 - 10 pieces will be in each game).  The playing field contains between 2 and 5 cylinders, referred to as posts.  The posts' diameters are less than the inside diameter of the rings. The only user input is a button which controls a water jet at the bottom left of the playing field.

#### Objectives

Land each ring onto a post using only the water jet.

### Initial game state

All rings being the game at the bottom left just above the water jet.

### Current development goals

- decide javascript framework ([phaser](http://phaser.io/) or [pixijs](http://www.pixijs.com/))
- decide water and physics simulation framework ([box2d](http://box2d.org/) / [liquidfun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/))
